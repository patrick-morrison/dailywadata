# 31 Days of WA Data — AI Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
Daily exploration of Western Australia through open data. Maps and graphs, mostly.
One dataset per day throughout January 2026.

## Philosophy
- **Beautiful & Interesting**: Every visualization should be beautiful, interesting, and well-crafted
- **No Slop**: AI-assisted code is welcome, but no slop
- **Ethical Use**: All data used within permissions, properly credited
- **Open Collaboration**: Contributors welcome to repost and expand their work

## Workflow: Git Branches

**IMPORTANT**: Use one branch per day, merge to main for GitHub Pages deployment.

### Creating a New Day
1. **Branch naming**: `day{N}-{short-description}` (e.g., `day8-treesperth`)
2. **Create from main**: `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b day8-treesperth`
3. **Build the day**:
   - Create `day8-treesperth/` folder with index.html, main.js, styles.css, methods.md
   - Add entry to main `index.html` calendar (update link on appropriate day number)
   - Add entry to `sources.html` with source, processing, tech stack, and author

### When Day is Complete
1. **Merge to main**: Create PR or direct merge
2. **GitHub Pages**: Automatically deploys from main branch
3. **Keep branch**: Don't delete day branches for reference

## Current State
- Live site: https://dailywadata.com
- Server running: `python -m http.server 8000` for local dev
- Calendar links should point to folder (`day1-dotlidar/`) not index directly

## Key Reminders
- Update BOTH index.html calendar AND sources.html for each new day
- Include proper attribution and licensing info in methods.md
- Test on mobile (most people use mobile)
- Beautiful > functional (but both is better)
