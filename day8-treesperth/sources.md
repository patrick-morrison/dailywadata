# Trees in the City

**Rationale:** 
This is one of my favourite open datasets. It is so delightful! Looking at all of the trees on QGIS is a great way to understand what geospatial data is useful for, but this app is a way of exploring it on the ground. It shows you only the trees that are nearby, and lets you take note of which of the 314 species you have seen. This is also an experiment for me using localStorage on a phone web browser, with lightweight save/load to a text file.
