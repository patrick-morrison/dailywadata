# 31 Days of WA Data — January 2026

[dailywadata.com](https://dailywadata.com)

A daily exploration of Western Australia through open data. Maps and graphs, mostly.

This is a group of Perth coders, data nerds and scientists who are spending January doing data experiments.

## Philosophy

- **One dataset a day.** A new take on Western Australian data every day throughout January. This advent calendar is in January because December is too busy.
- **Ethical use.** All data is used within published permissions and properly credited. Our posts are CC BY 4.0 where possible. We appreciate the work and occasional complexity behind sharing data openly.
- **Carefully curated.** Every visualisation should be beautiful, interesting, and well-crafted. AI-assisted code is welcome—but no slop.
- **Open collaboration.** Want to contribute? Message the contributors. Crossposting is encouraged—contributors are welcome to repost and expand on their work on their own blogs etc.

## For Contributors

We are building this openly. Here are the key instructions for contributing:

- **Branching**: Use one branch per day (`day{N}-{short-description}`). Merge to main when complete to deploy to GitHub Pages.
- **Mobile and Desktop**: Most people will view this on mobile, 
- **Attribution**: Include proper attribution and licensing info in a `methods.md` file for your day, and in the sources html.

AI agents should read [`AGENTS.txt`](AGENTS.txt) for specific instructions.

### Technical Note
We need to be mindful of Git's 1GB soft limit - which we will try to stay under. This keeps everything well web optimised too.
